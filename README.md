Summary of Changes May 2025:

Added agent invitation functionality with a new "Invite Agent" button in the control bar. The button triggers an API call to the agent dispatch service and automatically disables itself when an agent joins the room. Includes proper state management for tracking agent presence and handling connection events.

Summary of Changes  April 2025:
Introduced AgentVisualizerOverlay.tsx Component:
Created a new component specifically designed to overlay visual elements onto agent participant tiles.
Utilizes LiveKit hooks (useParticipants, useTracks) to identify participants marked as agents (p.isAgent) and locate their microphone audio tracks (Track.Source.Microphone).
Implements logic to dynamically find the corresponding DOM element for each agent's tile (.lk-participant-tile) by querying the DOM and matching the agent's identity within the participant name <span>.
Calculates the position (getBoundingClientRect) of the agent's tile during the render cycle.
Uses ReactDOM.createPortal to render a div containing a BarVisualizer and the agent's identity directly into document.body.
Applies absolute positioning CSS to the portal div based on the calculated tile coordinates, effectively layering the visualizer onto the agent's tile.
Refined the useEffect logic to prevent infinite render loops by separating state updates from DOM measurements. State now primarily stores identified agents and their tracks, while DOM querying and positioning occur during render.
Added styling to control the size (height) and placement (transform) of the visualizer overlay at the bottom of the agent tile.
Integrated AgentVisualizerOverlay into AgentAwareVideoConference.tsx:
The AgentAwareVideoConference component now renders the <AgentVisualizerOverlay /> alongside the standard <VideoConference /> component, allowing the overlay to function without modifying the core video conference layout.
